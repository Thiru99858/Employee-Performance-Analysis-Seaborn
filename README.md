# Employee Performance Analysis using Seaborn 📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of employee data to understand performance trends, salary distribution, and experience impact across departments.  
The analysis is performed using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, with a strong emphasis on data visualization and business insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze employee age distribution  
- Compare salary distribution across departments  
- Study the relationship between experience and salary  
- Understand performance rating distribution  
- Identify the relationship between performance ratings and salary using a heatmap  

---

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `Employee_ID` – Unique identifier for employees  
- `Department` – Employee department (IT, HR, Finance, Sales)  
- `Age` – Employee age  
- `Experience` – Years of experience  
- `Salary` – Employee salary  
- `Performance_Rating` – Performance score (2–5)

## 📊 Analysis & Visualizations

### 1️⃣ Employee Age Distribution
- Histogram with KDE to understand age spread
- Most employees fall within the mid-career age range

### 2️⃣ Salary Distribution by Department
- Violin plot to compare salary spread across departments
- Highlights variation and central tendencies

### 3️⃣ Experience vs Salary Relationship
- Scatter plot showing positive correlation
- Higher experience generally leads to higher salary

### 4️⃣ Performance Rating Distribution
- Count plot with department-wise comparison
- Most employees receive mid to high performance ratings

### 5️⃣ Performance vs Salary (Advanced Analysis)
- Heatmap showing **average salary by performance rating**
- Clear upward trend indicating pay-for-performance structure

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Employee salaries increase with experience and performance rating  
- Departments like Finance and HR show higher average performance ratings  
- Performance rating has a strong positive relationship with salary  
- Low performance ratings are relatively rare
